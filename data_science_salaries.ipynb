        "### Description\n",
        "In this assignment, you will work with a dataset containing salary information for data science roles from various countries, industries, and experience levels. The dataset includes key details such as job titles, salary amounts (both in local currencies and USD), remote work ratios, company sizes, and more. Through this assignment, you will explore data manipulation techniques using pandas, including filtering and aggregation.\n",

        "### Guidance on Using GPT for Assistance\n",
        "If you find yourself stuck during the assignment, remember that you can use tools like GPT to help guide you. However, it's important to reflect deeply on the problem before relying on external help. Use GPT as a way to clarify your understanding or get hints, but always take the time to carefully think through the logic of the question and the solution. Learning comes from working through challenges and understanding why a solution works. If you do use GPT, make sure to review and verify the answers yourself to ensure that they truly address the question.\n",

        "### Structuring the notebook\n",
        "When working on this assignment, it's important to structure your notebook in a clear and organized way. Start with a brief introduction outlining the objective of the task. Next, load and inspect the dataset, including necessary data cleaning or preprocessing steps. Break the analysis into sections based on the questions or tasks, ensuring each section begins with a markdown cell that explains the purpose of the code. Use meaningful comments within your code to make it easier to understand. A well-structured notebook not only helps you stay organized but also makes your work more readable and professional.\n"
